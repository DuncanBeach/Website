            8/25/23 - First Journal entry. We did nothing important today.
        </p>

        <p>
            9//8 - second journal entry.<br><br>we began construction on the Tungsten Guilletine. The concept is sound. we will drop a 2/3 pound cubic inch of tungsten onto a small balloon. Hypothetically, this should be able to pop the thin rubber. The cube will be attached to a string hanging over a pulley. the other end of the string will have a ring attached, witch will be hooked onto something to anchor the cube. By knocking or pulling the anchoring pin or hook out of the ring, the cube is allowed to accelerate by its own gravity towards the balloon below. <br><br><img src="2023-09-11.png" width="360px" height="240"></p>

            9//13 - third journal entry.<br><br>The Guillotine has formed nicely. We had to redo many parts of its design. At first, we cadded a more historic version of a guillotine, but the tall structure created stability and cunstruction problems. Also, instead of a hook attached to a wheel and axle that would swing and release the string, we whent with an anchoring pin that would be yanked out by the attached baseball as it passes by. Also, the first 2/3rds of the project has been fleshed out. A small HotWheels car will roll down an inclined plane, setting a baseball into motion on a seperate inclined plane that runs parallel to the pin and perpendicular to the tungsten cubes harnessing string. The baseball has a string connecting it and the pin mooring the string that holds the cube from falling, and as it rolls down the ramp it will fling itself off the table, ripping the pin out with it.   <br><br><img src="IMG_20230913_120400.jpg" width="360px" height="240"><img src="IMG_20230913_120357.jpg" width="360px" height="240"><img src="IMG_20230913_114647.jpg" width="360px" height="240"></p>

            9//8 - fourth journal entry.<br><br>It is complete. The guillotine has been tested and can pop a balloon easily. We encountered problems in early testing with the baseball and hotwheels car. The baseball had a small impediment to keep it from rolling down on its own. At times, this obstacle was inconsistant, and on occassion the hotwheels would not be able to set the ball a-rolling. To combat this, the hotwheels car's ramp was extended greatly, with the newer section placed at an even greater angle. This cleared all problems up. Repeated uses of the guillotine seems to break the cubes carriage over time, however, so after we finished the final test by popping the balloon (see video below), we stopped testing it.  <br><br><img src="IMG_20230915_110850.jpg" width="360px" height="240"><img src="20230913_114647.jpg" width="360px" height="240"></p>
